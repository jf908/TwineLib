# TwineLib

An NMS-based API for some things missing in Bukkit.

APIs for

 * Ghost entities which have collision disabled (allowing their velocity to directly control their position).
 * Structure blocks (allowing you to get a list of all the blocks in the structure without putting it in the world).
