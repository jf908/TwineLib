# TwineLib

An NMS-based API for some things missing in Bukkit.

APIs for

- Ghost entities which have collision disabled (allowing their velocity to directly control their position).
- Structure blocks (allowing you to get a list of all the blocks in the structure without putting it in the world).

## Dev Notes

Make sure to run `java -jar BuildTools.jar --rev {mc version goes here} --remapped` before you any maven shenanigans to get mappings into the local repo.
